		<h3>Thinking about design is hard, but not thinking about it can be disastrous_Ralph Caplan</h3>
		
		<p>I’ve never really had a career in any other field or seriously considered another field of study, so I’ll have to discuss why I decided to major in design and stay in the field.</p>
		
		<p>Background: I studied Arts while I was high school student. While studying art, I started to want to make or create something. I started to feel confidence while I was doing art and decided to go on to design at Niagara College.</p>
		
		<h4>Projects instead of tests</h4>
		
		<p>Frankly, one of the major reasons I studied design was because there were no exams. I was good at studying, it just didn’t seem like a good method of evaluation or use of time. I would often get swept up in studying test-taking strategies rather than the content itself, meaning I forget knowledge quickly once the test is over.</p>
		
		<p>So not only was it relaxing to have the week off while everyone else was studying for exams, but the project-based curriculum really helped me hone my collaboration and communication skills.</p>
		
		<h4>More interested in people-problems than computer-problems</h4>
		
		<p>I was fortunate to grow up with computers and internet at home, and knew I wanted to work with them as a career. If I had more exposure to computer science in High School, I might have more seriously considered that path, but it seemed boring to me (lectures and exams) and most of my electives were spent in art classes.</p>
		
		<p>Design seemed like a good balance between complex problem solving (science and technology) and the open-ended activity (arts) that I enjoyed. Despite being an introvert, I am incredibly fascinated by observing how people and communities think and behave and I knew design had a huge influence in that.</p>
		
		<h4>Belief I can make an impact on the world</h4>
		
		<p>Everyone wants a legacy that outlasts their own lifespan. At most technology companies, design is only second to engineering in the ability to build things people use. And in my original field of study (graphic design), designers were the real creators of the artifacts that represented and influenced human cultures throughout history. Humans are naturally illogical, and little mastermind me hungered for the little bit of power designers had on human behavior.</p>
		
		<p>In high school, I emailed an alumni of my to-be alma mater to discuss the ethics of design & advertising. The ethics and responsibility of designers in our communities has strongly influenced the projects I choose to work on, the industries I choose to work in (currently in education), and the messages I wish to communicate.</p>
